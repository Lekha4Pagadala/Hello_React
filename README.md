2 types of export

-1. default export /import 
export default Component;
import  Component from "/path";

-2. named export/import
 export const var_name="";
 import {var_name} from "/path";
only use named import/export only doing multiple exports if its one only default we can use

//if we use both default and named export at a time for one component then it doesnt give any error
